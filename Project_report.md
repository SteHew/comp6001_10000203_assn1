# <span style="color:lightgreen">Best Practices for GUI Programming</span>

This report surveys eight design principles to apply when creating an app or webpage using Javascript or another programming language.

<br>

## <span style="color:lightgreen; font-family:verdana">1. Familiarity</span>

The user will be more positive, more quickly bonded to a new app when he or she can readily apprehend the options presented and feel comfortable with the aesthetics and content. &nbsp; The appearance, the relative sizing, the colour scheme, and the location of various objects should present no big surprises or deterrents.

Patel (2016) writes about 'eye tracking' and the need to design with that in mind.

>"When we're reading text or looking at a website, we don't typically think about how our eyes and brain are piecing together a puzzle at that very moment. &nbsp; Images, navigation, words, and layout work together to orient (or disorient) us so we can quickly find what we need."

To minimise the number of eye movements - called _saccades_ - and draw the user's gaze to the most relevant elements, Patel recommends judicious use of size, location and colour. &nbsp; He cites eye-tracking studies, conducted in 1999 and 2011, which show that "users tend to read in an __`F-shaped`__ pattern." &nbsp; Programmers need to bear this in mind in the layout of an app or webpage.

Familiarity may be measured by the number of eye movements but its main objective is the engagement of cognitive processes established by experience. &nbsp; The user expects to see the kind of layout and components typical elsewhere.

<br>

## <span style="color:lightgreen; font-family:verdana">2. Consistency</span>

Consistency is closely related to Familiarity. &nbsp; Both involve the user encountering features found in other apps. &nbsp; However, the Consistency principle is about both external ___and___ internal standardardization. &nbsp; Also, its emphasis is on structure and function more than the aesthetics.  &nbsp; Consistency is important for icons, navigation bars, buttons, colour coding, text input, and payment processing. 

The user should be able to navigate and operate an app by clicking and typing in the same sequence and to similar effect as in the most widely used apps. &nbsp; As stated in the article entitled _10 User Interface Design Fundamentals_:  
“Your users need consistency. &nbsp; They need to know that once they learn to do something, they will be able to do it again.”

Portman (2016) stresses the value of consistency in her list of _Core Principles of UI Design_. &nbsp; She recommends the programmer employs a “strong visual hierarchy” and maintains “visual order” with “a consistent color scheme throughout the app.” &nbsp; Using the same elements in different areas, and maintaining uniform navigation methods contribute to a positive user experience.

As stated in the article, _Principles of User Interface Design_:
>"When someone or something behaves consistently with our expectations, we feel like we have a good relationship with it. &nbsp; To that end design elements should look like how they behave. &nbsp; Form follows function. &nbsp; In practice this means that someone should be able to predict how an interface element will behave merely by looking at it."

<br>

## <span style="color:lightgreen; font-family:verdana">3. Simplicity</span>

Many of the lists of Best Practices, or Design Principles, for user interface programming include 'KISS', or, ___Keep it Simple, Stupid !___ &nbsp; One article ("10 User Interface Design Fundamentals") puts it this way:
> "Never let your UI ego steal the show!"

It is tempting for the programmer to keep adding bonus features and layers of complexity with the intention of enhancing the user experience. &nbsp; Yet, this approach can backfire as users become frustrated or confused by elaborate app features and pathways.

An article on www.usability.gov makes the point of simplicity well when it states:  
“The best interfaces are almost invisible to the user. &nbsp; They avoid unnecessary elements and are clear in the language they use on labels and in messaging.”

Simplicity of design is instinctively appealing in any area of human activity, and the programmer should keep this in mind. &nbsp; Many of the most popular computer games of all time (e.g. Pacman and Mario Brothers) are noted for their simplicity. &nbsp; Simplicity is a major factor in the success of Microsoft products, in the sales of accounting software packages, and in Google's rise to supremacy over every other search engine competitor.

<br>

## <span style="color:lightgreen; font-family:verdana">4. Flexibility</span>

Portman (2016) recommends that the programmer "design something that looks good in all situations" implying 'responsiveness' for viewing on different sized screens. &nbsp; She adds, "Account for all the devices and resolutions." &nbsp; In an age when computer devices are being produced in many forms, any new apps should be designed with this fact in mind.

Relative positioning is key to achieving 'responsiveness'. &nbsp; In an article titled _What is the best practice for programming a UI in Java?_ we are advised to "avoid absolute positioning whenever possible." &nbsp; It recommends using code to automatically size and position components.

The principle of Flexibility extends not only to 'responsiveness' but also to the way in which users navigate and operate the app. &nbsp; One way to word this, again quoting from _10 User Interface Design Fundamentals_, is: 
>"Be forgiving... Your UI should allow for and tolerate user errors. &nbsp; Design ways for users to undo actions, and be forgiving with varied inputs...."

A flexible app will allow users to move forwards or backwards without losing the data they have entered along the way. &nbsp; It may also provide different routes to arrive at the same destination. &nbsp; The main thing is that the user will be able to achieve his or her objective without being forced to repeat or start over.

<br>

## <span style="color:lightgreen; font-family:verdana">5. Feedback</span>

This principle is about informing users with visual cues and messaging as to their progress through the app, as to the status of their input, and guiding them where to go or what to do next.

_Principles of User Interface Design_ cautions against over-explaining, or putting too much detail on any one screen, but instead progressively disclosing information as required. &nbsp; Yet, it still advocates building in help messages wherever possible, without intruding on the experience of regular users.

'Provide feedback' is one of the 10 items listed in _10 User Interface Design Fundamentals_. &nbsp; There it states:
> "Always inform your users of actions, changes in state, and errors or exceptions that occur. &nbsp; Visual cues or simple messaging can show the user whether his or her actions have led to the expected result."

Feedback can come in different forms, from simple labelling, to sidebar comments, to pop up messages. &nbsp; Even the use of colour coding is a means of giving feedback. &nbsp; Colour can inform the user that a task is completed, or is yet to be completed, or is especially important.

<br>

## <span style="color:lightgreen; font-family:verdana">6. Be Purposeful</span>

A number of ideas are wrapped up in this principle.

It includes the concept of using structure and setting tasks that lead the user through the app. &nbsp; It involves creating expectations and making the app behave in keeping with those expectations (Principle 8 in "Best Practices & Principles for GUI design".) &nbsp; It's about structuring the page to draw attention to the most important elements. &nbsp; It involves the strategic use of colour and texture. &nbsp; And, taking care with fonts, and the arrangement of text. &nbsp; (Principles 3, 4 & 5 in "User Interface Design Basics".)

Essentially, the programmer should have a clear intent or idea of the purpose of the app. &nbsp; Each element and textual component should be meaningful and concise, leading toward an objective. &nbsp; The user should not feel that his or her time is wasted by frivolous diversions or poorly planned paths to the end goal. 

<br>

## <span style="color:lightgreen; font-family:verdana">7. Know the User</span>

The user demographic will be determined by the purpose of the app. &nbsp; A gaming app will likely attract younger users with an apptitude for technology, an addiction for adrenalin, and enough financial resource to purchase entertainment software. &nbsp;An accounting app will cater to an older demographic with a significant income, a professional mindset, and a focus on obtaining the best product for their business requirements.

The article _Best Practices & Principles for GUI Design_ advises that the programmer should "fit the appearance and behavior of the UI to the environment / process / audience." &nbsp; Further on it mentions the language used, avoiding programming jargon and adopting the vocabulary of the target user.

The list available at _10 User Interface Design Fundamentals_ includes as a principle: "Speak their language".
>“Keep things conversational, not sensational. &nbsp; Your users will appreciate it because they won't hear you - they will hear themselves and/or their peers.”

<br>

## <span style="color:lightgreen; font-family:verdana">8. Reduce HTTP requests</span>

It is well known in the programming community that multiple HTTP 'requests' slows functionality. &nbsp; There are various ways to reduce the number of requests made by an application (Weyl, 2013).  

Programming resources, such as jQuery and JSON libraries, can be cached on a local machine or network. &nbsp; Concatenating CSS into a single stylesheet, and putting javascript into a single file, can help to reduce HTTP requests. &nbsp; Images can be compressed to reduce the size of HTTP requests. &nbsp; Relying on font characters rather than icons will also achieve this objective.

Apps with faster functionality are welcomed by the online end user.

<br>

## <span style="color:lightgreen; font-family:verdana">Conclusion</span>

This list is not exhaustive. &nbsp; There are many other lists available on the internet; one had 19 'principles', though some of those are overlapped.

I hope to incorporate at least some of what is listed here in the background colour app that accompanies this report.

#### Date: 10 August 2017


Stephen has done a robust analysis on his report on GUI best practies. He has given an indepth view of eight design priciples that we apply when creating an app or webpages. It is very nice to see that Stephen have worked hard to search some quality articles that helped him understand what really a GUI good practices are.
I am quite pleased with his report and hope that he will use these priciples to make his work stand out.

THANK YOU.
